# minishell
Environment : MacOS - Yosemite
Should work on linux.

Minishell is the beginning of a higher project in which we have to recreate a shell from the beginning.
It means that, in the end, it should do exactly what your shell does, and even more!
For now there is not much functionalities, it is not POSIX and not finished, but you can still try it, it works well.
Actually, here are the functionnalities :
- Manage an environment
- Understand some built-in commands
- Launch these commands via the PATH env variable if they're not built-ins
- A lot more in fact
- etc.
